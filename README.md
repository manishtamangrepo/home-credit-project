Home Credit Default Risk Prediction — A machine learning capstone project analyzing consumer credit data to predict loan default risk using feature engineering, EDA, and predictive modeling.
Many individuals struggle to obtain loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Unfortunately, this underserved population is often exposed to unfair or unreliable lending practices.

Home Credit Group aims to improve financial inclusion by providing safe, transparent, and responsible lending to the unbanked population. To achieve this, Home Credit leverages a wide range of alternative data sources, including telecommunications and transactional data, to better assess clients’ repayment abilities.

This project is based on the Home Credit Default Risk competition from Kaggle and serves as my school capstone project.
